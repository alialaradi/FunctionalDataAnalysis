# FunctionalDataAnalysis
MATLAB code to produce results and figures in the project "Functional data analysis of AIDS clinical trials data using principal analysis by conditional expectation" (http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/~ali/papers/FDAproject.pdf)

The main script to produce results and plots is FDA_script.m - running this script requires the PACE package for Functional Data Analysis and Empirical Dynamics (written in Matlab) which can be freely downloaded from: http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/PACE/download.html

Note: this script was written with version 2.16 of PACE and is not guaranteed to work with other versions.

The CD4 data for the analysis is found in the text file cd4.txt. 

This dataset is the AIDS Clinical Trials Group, ACTG 315, Longitudinal Data (Viral Load and CD4+ TCell Counts for Time-Varying Coefficient Models) sponsored by NIAID/NIH. It can be found here: https://sph.uth.edu/divisions/biostatistics/wu/datasets/ACTG315LongitudinalDataViralLoadData.htm
