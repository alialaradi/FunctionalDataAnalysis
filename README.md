# FunctionalDataAnalysis
MATLAB code to produce results and figures in the project "Functional data analysis of AIDS clinical trials data using principal analysis by conditional expectation" (http://www.utstat.utoronto.ca/~ali/papers/FDAproject.pdf)

The main script to produce results and plots is FDA_script.m - running this script requires the free PACE package for Functional Data Analysis and Empirical Dynamics (written in Matlab) which can be downloaded from: http://www.stat.ucdavis.edu/PACE/download.html
Note that this script was written with version 2.16 of PACE and is not guaranteed to work with other versions.
